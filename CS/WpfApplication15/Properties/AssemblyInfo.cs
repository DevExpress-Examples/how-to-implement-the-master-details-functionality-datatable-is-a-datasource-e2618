// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to implement the Master-Details functionality (DataTable is a DataSource)
// 
// DataRow does not have a property that includes all child rows. So, it is
// impossible to bind the child GridControl DataSource to child rows collection via
// xaml directly. A solution is to implement a multi binding converter. In this
// converter, pass the RowHandle and the ActiveView. In the Convert method, create
// a DataView passing a child table to the DataView constructor, filter this
// DataView based by the current value of the RowHandle, return the filtered
// DataView.
// 
// You can find sample updates and versions for different programming languages here:
